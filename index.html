    <h1> "THE Simon Dunham" </h1>

    <p> "Thank you for navigating to my page! I'm currently a student at Florida Gulf Coast University, in the Whitaker College of Engineering for Software Engineering. My name, in case you missed the title, is Simon Dunham. There are many things about me that I could babble on about for hours. What can I say? I'm fabulous. But perhaps the most important point to get across would be that I love to challenge myself. "Mental Masochism" my father once called it. The desire to put myself through the most I can possibly endure to find the best results. And this doesn't just apply to academics. Socially, athletically, spiritually, I am inclined to be my best, solely from an obligation to make myself better for the sake of others and society as a whole. I've earned five years of awards through my high school and the county I competed in for tennis. Despite also being an essentialy free taxi for many people desperate for transportation, as well as a full time student in the International Baccaleaureate Program, I liked to make time to challenge myself in tennis. I found that the necessity to strenghten your mind and all aspects of your body as well made me a more well-rounded person. Academic awards came as well, along with nearly 750,000 dollars in scholarships total from the thirteen schools I applied to. I also like to think of myself as a very reliable person. I credit my hectic schedule and constant need for organization for this." </p>
